## Project Description

### 1Ô∏è. led.c  
Basic LED blinking using RD2 pin:
- Turns LED ON and OFF every 1 second.
- Demonstrates delay usage and PORTD control.

### 2Ô∏è. dual_led.c  
Advanced control of two LEDs (RD1 and RD7):
- Alternates ON/OFF states of RD1 and RD7.
- Controls both pins simultaneously in different combinations.
